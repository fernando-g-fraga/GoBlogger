## The Objective
This project goal is to consolidate my knowladge in GoLang with a very handson web application that everyone is familiar with, a blog! In order to to this, i will start referencing the blog series of <a src= "https://www.calhoun.io/building-a-blog-exercise/">@calhun</a>. 

## Breaking down the goals:


1. Set up a basic HTTP server that responds to web requests.
2. Read markdown from local files and display this when someone requests a specific post.
3. Explore markdown libraries and start rendering my markdown with one.
4. Look for ways to add syntax highlighting to code blocks in my markdown.
5. Add code to list all blog posts, or possibly pages of posts.

## Beyond the Project
The main reason to invest time and effort on this project is, to create more awareness of my developer skills and my current level and also generate content, since this will be all documented and posted on my LinkedIn page.
